<p>Web text guidelines: Writing for people who don’t “read” Purpose of this guide Assume your website is people’s first choice for information about your area. They decide how well your department meets their needs based on the quality of your site. These gu idelines for effective web writing are meant to help you ensure that you’re giving your audience the information it nee ds and leaving people with a posit ive impression . Above all, remember this:<br />
    It’s NOT about what you want to tell people. It’s about what people want to know. What users want Think about your online reading habits. You set out looking for specific information. You judge sites by how effectively they give you that information. The visitors to your website are no different: • They want specific information – and expect it fast • They ignore “blah -blah” text such as Mission Statements, official welcomes, etc . • they don’t read – they scan to cherry -pick information • if they don’t see what they want, they click away in a nanosecond Don’t “write” – bundle Break your w eb text into succinct, discrete chunks of useful information: • use bulleted lists 
    <br />• emphasize the key words your readers are scan ning for • bold key words • sentences fragments are okay Avoid large block s of text Pe ople don’t read them – too much work . Break long paragraphs into shorter ones. Use explanatory headings As we did here. They should be “ pearls of clarity ”-- clearly describ ing the content they introduce. Provide answers It’s NOT about what you want to tell people. It’s about what people want to know. Give people the information they want , right up front. Put the secondary and background information where it belongs – in the background, on secondary pages. Layer the information Brevity is a virtue. But if you know that some users want richer, more detailed content you can provide it through links that allow them to “drill down” to secondary pages on your site or to pages on third - party sites . W eak : It’s important to budget carefully for your time at college.</p>
